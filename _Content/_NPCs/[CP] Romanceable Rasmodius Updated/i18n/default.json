    "Wizard.Dialogue.spring_Fri4": "I have never used the Shrine of Illusion, but I do not fault those that do. It is important to project who you truly are.#$b#If you do not, what you are will eat itself out from the inside, and that is not pleasant.#$e#Focus your mind today, @, and be at peace.",

It would have been better if you hadn't gotten involved.#$e#Seek knowledge, seek answers. Have a good one.",
    "Wizard.Dialogue.spring_Sun6": "Joy is a mysterious power. Fragile in its most pure state, when it does appear it can resonate through the ages.#$b#Yet, that same joy can become corrupted over time. It must be protected, at all costs.#$e#Be enchanted, @. Be at peace.",

    "Wizard.Dialogue.spring_Wed8": "I will tell you of one place that I have been to. While lost in a forest, I found a cabin and took shelter in it.#$b#It was larger than it appeared on the inside, and it seemed to go on for miles.#$b#At the end, I found a bed, and in it, a child.

    "Wizard.Dialogue.spring_Fri8": "Where I come from the libraries would be brimming with life. Every page a portal, recorded down by scribes long past.#$b#Some were full of secrets no one should know, and I took to them immediately. I regret it still.{{sad}}#$e#Focus your mind today, @, and be at peace.",

    "Wizard.Dialogue.spring_Fri10": "I feel renewed this year, not just because spring is the time for it, but because of my relationship with you, @.{{happy}}#$b#You have reminded me that I am still human. To focus on being human is a mystery itself that I almost forgot about.{{happy}}#$e#Thank you, @.{{happy}}",
    "Wizard.Dialogue.spring_Sat10": "The air is electric, I feel this year will be a special one. Let us do our best to achieve our dreams, @.#$e#Do not give up. I will be with you.",

    "Wizard.Dialogue.summer_Tue": "The bush with eyes of blue, it can see many things. Its power is in healing, and as such, is quite potent indeed.#$b#People crave them, but they are hard to find most of the year, and only good fresh. A crop whose quality is fleeting, very mysterious.#$e#Embrace the mysteries of the day, @.",
    "Wizard.Dialogue.summer_Wed": "Melon of the Earth, Melon of the Sky, Melon of the People, Melon of the Eye.#$b#Melon of the Mother, Melon of the Father, Melon of the Son, Melon of the Daughter#$b#That concludes my shopping list.{{surprised}}#$e##$e#Have a good day, @. Learn something new.",
    "Wizard.Dialogue.summer_Thu": "It is now that the crops that can make energy are born, and it is up to people like yourself to harness it.#$b#There are two crops available, and one has its seeds. To utilize them is pure alchemy.#$e#Seek the energies, @. Enjoy the day.",
    "Wizard.Dialogue.summer_Fri": "A powerful plant, it can induce dreams in those who drink it. Its powers many, its flavors are endless.#$b#Yet, it has brought ruin to civilizations, and is no friend of men or women. What is its true purpose?#$e#Focus your mind today, @, and be at peace.",

    "Wizard.Dialogue.summer_Mon2": "Long ago, there was a language that allowed people to converse with the spirits of the sun.

    "Wizard.Dialogue.summer_Tue2": "The energy during summer allows for easier methods of the mysterious. It is very addicting trying out new theories after two seasons of wondering.#$b#Can you feel the energies? Do not worry if you cannot.#$e#Embrace the mysteries of the day, @.",
    "Wizard.Dialogue.summer_Wed2": "It was said that only the most powerful could learn and write the Sun Language, for it could burn those who wrote it.#$b#It is rumored that there was a rival tribe that wrote in a special moon rune, but there has been no proof of such a language ever existing.#$e#Have a good day, @.

    "Wizard.Dialogue.summer_Sat2": "Tomorrow I will be focusing my energy, and doing an experiment that could go very well, or very badly.

    "Wizard.Dialogue.summer_Tue4": "The previous owner of the Shrine of Illusion was a vain man, trying to find the perfect look for himself. He was wealthy, and won the shrine in a contest.#$b#He invested all his wealth into it, trying to find the perfect look, but he was never happy.#$b#He was trying to fix what was on the outside and not the inside, and it consumed him. Strange, isn't it?#$e#Embrace the mysteries of the day, @.",
    "Wizard.Dialogue.summer_Wed4": "I found a warning in an old book regarding the Shrine of Illusion. It went as follows:#$b#'Only those who wish to find their true self are permitted to use the Shrine. Those who wish to change their appearance to trick others shall be cursed.'#$b#I've spent a long time trying to find what the curse is, but only have theories.#$e#Have a good day, @. Learn something new.",
    "Wizard.Dialogue.summer_Thu4": "My guesses for the Curse of the Shrine of Illusion are that if you use it for your own gain, and not to reveal your true self, your time on this mortal plane is cut short.#$b#Many have tried to use it as such, and all were destroyed. But this is just a theory of mine, nothing concrete about it.#$e#Seek the energies, @. Enjoy the day.",
    "Wizard.Dialogue.summer_Fri4": "It is curious to me why the Shrine demands gold for its use. If it was a construct of good, it shouldn't matter.#$b#Yet, it will not work without a gold offering. Such a curious thing.#$e#Focus your mind today, @, and be at peace.",
    "Wizard.Dialogue.summer_Sat4": "There is no proof of any kind that the Shrine of Illusion is more powerful during summer or not. All other sorts of mysterious objects are, but it appears indifferent.#$e#Seek knowledge, seek answers. Have a good one.",
    "Wizard.Dialogue.summer_Sun4": "I believe you to be a good person, @, so the Shrine should be kind to you. If I misjudged you, then...#$b#You might still be fine. I'll have to see.#$e#Be enchanted, @. Be at peace.",
    "Wizard.Dialogue.summer_Mon6": "My ex-wife was my companion.

    "Wizard.Dialogue.summer_Wed6": "To be lucky in love is a special sort of energy that not all beings possess. It strikes randomly, and only once.#$b#I have been hoping for another chance for many years, but to no avail.{{sad}}#$e#Have a good day, @. Learn something new.",
    "Wizard.Dialogue.summer_Thu6": "I once conjured a being that was a talking cat.

I wonder where it is now.#$e#Seek the energies, @. Enjoy the day.",

    "Wizard.Dialogue.summer_Sat6": "It is a dangerous power to wonder about how things could have been. It is impossible to know, but it can be a destructive force.#$b#It's better to always do what you feel is right so you have no regrets. Doing what you feel is wrong, but doing it anyway, is madness.#$e#Seek knowledge, seek answers. Have a good one.",

    "Wizard.Dialogue.summer_Mon8": "One of things I did when I was younger was hunt and fight evil beings and creatures.

    "Wizard.Dialogue.summer_Tue8": "The problem with monsters is that most of the time they do not know why they do what they are doing.#$b#Some are created, or others are enchanted in some terrible way.

    "Wizard.Dialogue.summer_Wed8": "There was a war, fought long ago, that almost swallowed the entire world.

Learn something new.",
    "Wizard.Dialogue.summer_Thu8": "In youth, my powers were attuned for fighting, and I could hold my own. It was a heart-pounding time.#$b#Unfortunately, it cost me some years of my life. I have little to show for it other than the scars.{{sad}}#$e#Seek the energies, @. Enjoy the day.",
    "Wizard.Dialogue.summer_Fri8": "The mines go deeper than you might imagine, and there are secrets locked away that will probably never be found.#$b#It is my hope that all the horrible things that happened down there stay there, and sometimes I must interfere.#$e#Focus your mind today, @, and be at peace.",
    "Wizard.Dialogue.summer_Sat8": "Anger and hatred, they are false energies. They hide the real sources of power, which is understanding and sadness.#$b#It has become cliche, but it's true. I have learned so much, and it still holds true. Find peace before you tear yourself to pieces.#$e#Seek knowledge, seek answers. Have a good one.",
    "Wizard.Dialogue.summer_Sun8": "Someday things will be at peace with the beings in the mines, but not anytime soon. Probably not until the world is but a husk, and humans are long gone.#$b#That is how deep their hatred burns. It is a tragedy of the ages.#$e#Be enchanted, @. Be at peace.",

I always will be.{{embarassed}}",
    "Wizard.Dialogue.summer_Thu10": "Using the energies comes at a cost. It's not free. To discuss all the different aspects would take ages.#$b#I'll tell you this though, @. My hair was not originally purple.#$e#That was a long time ago...",
